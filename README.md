# </The Modern Psychedelia-"Acid Graphics">

#### Acid Graphics is a late-twentieth-century style. It is distinguished by brutalist typefaces, forms, and a psychedelic imagination. It draws inspiration from the Y2K style, cyberdelia, and 90's rave fliers.

## What comes to mind when you hear the word "Acid"?  
## Is this a throwback to the Acid House, Techno, and Rave parties of the 1990s?            
## Or how about the Paisley psychedelic swirl design and Op Art, which were popular in the hippie movement? 

### Although most people associate this word with a strong psychedelic experience journey, it is actually a description with various meanings and a deeper cultural resonance than its noun form.

## "Acid Graphic" 
This design approach is related to the visual experience provided by psychedelic materials, which are frequently displayed in repeated geometric patterns or high-saturation colours. This acidic aesthetics conveyed a societal proposal of "free love" and featured a form of extreme hedonism that is nearly obsolete in today's society in the last several decades.

## Stylistically, there are of course still a few smileys in there, but mostly this new style of graphics is defined by a miasma of bright colors
There’s a hell of a lot of neon green;experimental typograph-it’s warped, back to front, upside down, takes on the appearance of viscously dripping liquid metal; op-art-esque patterns; sci-fi futurism; and the odd ’70s throwback, with dystopian-tinged skies and desert scenes that owe more than a little to legendary ’60s studio Hipgnosis.

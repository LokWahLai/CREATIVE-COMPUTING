# </The Modern Psychedelia-"Acid Graphics">

#### Acid Graphics is a late-twentieth-century style. It is distinguished by brutalist typefaces, forms, and a psychedelic imagination. It draws inspiration from the Y2K style, cyberdelia, and 90's rave fliers.

What comes to mind when you hear the word "Acid"? Is this a throwback to the Acid House, Techno, and Rave parties of the 1990s? Or how about the Paisley psychedelic swirl design and Op Art, which were popular in the hippie movement? Although most people associate this word with a strong psychedelic experience journey, it is actually a description with various meanings and a deeper cultural resonance than its noun form.

There is a visual aesthetic known as "Acid Graphic" in the realm of design. This design approach is related to the visual experience provided by psychedelic materials, which are frequently displayed in repeated geometric patterns or high-saturation colours. This acidic aesthetics conveyed a societal proposal of "free love" and featured a form of extreme hedonism that is nearly obsolete in today's society in the last several decades.
